Key Concepts:-

VectorAssembler: Combines multiple columns into a single vector column.

Training Data: Data used to train the machine learning model.

Prediction: Using the trained model to predict the target variable on new data.

Evaluation Metrics: Metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, e.g., MSE, RMSE.

1. Data Preparation
You have a dataset in a tabular format with columns: Name, Age, Experience, and Salary.

2. Schema:
The schema of the DataFrame shows the data types of each column.

3. VectorAssembler:
VectorAssembler is a feature transformer that combines a given list of columns into a single vector column. This is often used in machine learning pipelines to combine features into a single vector column for training models.

4. Data Selection for Model Training:
You select the Independent Features and Salary columns for model training.

5. Model Training:
You likely trained a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression) using Independent Features to predict Salary.

6. Model Prediction:
The model is used to make predictions on the test data.

7. Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
